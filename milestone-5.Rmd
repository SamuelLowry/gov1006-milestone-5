# Overview 

<i> Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots </i> by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, and Markus Wagner in the <i>The Journal of Politics</i> aims to answer the driving question of, "Why do politicians with strong local roots receive more electoral support?" by running and analyzing two separate studies. The first study uses a "paired profiles factorial vignette design" by asking subjects to rate hypothetical members of Parliament on a scale from 1 to 10. The hypothetical members have varying levels of local roots as well as varying levels of "behavioral localism"—their track record of constituency service and if they act more so as a trustee or delegate. The analysis which is largely visualized in figure 1 consists of both the raw difference in ratings between varying levels of local roots and across levels of behavioral localism. It then uses models to predict the effect of having local roots which can be seen on display in my "beautiful graphic" In the second study, subjects again considered hypothetical members of Parliament with varying levels of local roots as compared to varying levels of behavioral localism mainly in the first study. In this case, the subjects also received information on their political preferences and partisan loyalties. The first study depicted that the additional information swayed rankings, but local roots still seemed to have an association no matter what. The second study agreed with these results stating that, "even if voters are provided with a rich array of information about politicians’ behavior and ideological positioning, the effect of local roots remained positive and notable." The remainder of the article discusses the nuances of these results within the frame of the driving question. It also attempts to contextualize these findings with the broader literature of the effects off in-group/out-group dynamics in the context of localism @paper.

All analysis for this paper is available in my Github repository for this milestone is in the footnote below. ^[https://github.com/SamuelLowry/gov1006-milestone-5.git]

I used @book and @maria in order to help me complete this milestone.
